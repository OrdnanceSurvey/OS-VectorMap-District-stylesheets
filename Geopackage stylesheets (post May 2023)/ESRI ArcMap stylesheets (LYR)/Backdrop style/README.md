# OS VectorMap District Backdrop style

These are **LYR** files for OS VectorMap District in **Geopackage** format for use in **ESRI ArcGIS**.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied, downloaded from the OS data Hub **after May 2023***

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-VectorMap-District-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Copy the font file 'OS_VMDistrict.otf' into your systems font directory (on Windows machines this is C:\Windows\Fonts). Replace any previous version

*Your machine may require a restart for ArcGIS to recognise this new font*

**3.**  Open a new blank map in ArcMap

**4.**  Right-click on ‘Layers’ at the top of the Table Of Contents, select Properties… > then General > set Reference Scale to 1:25 000 and set the Label Engine to ‘Maplex Label Engine’

**5.**  In the same window select the Frame tab and change the Background colour to R 250 G 249 B 247, and under the Coordinate System tab > choose British National Grid. You may need to reposition to the data extent

**6.**  Click on the ‘Add Data’ button and navigate to the stylesheets folder and the directory that matches your data format, stylesheet format and style preference

**7.**  Select the layer file and click ‘Add’

**8.**  Your Table of Contents should now look like this. This is the recommended layer order:

**9.**  Double-click on a layer to access the ‘Layer Properties’ window > select the ‘Source tab’ > click on ‘Set Data Source…’ > navigate to your OS VectorMap District data > select the data that matches the layer, for example for Airport select XX_Airport.shp (XX being the 100km tile name) > select ‘Add’

Repeat step 9 for all layers.

We recommend viewing the map between **1:10,000** and **1:25,000** for maximum legibility

Your map should now look similar to this:
